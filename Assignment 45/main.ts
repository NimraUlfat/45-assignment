//Task 45
//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should
//always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number 
//of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other 
//name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned 
//to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
