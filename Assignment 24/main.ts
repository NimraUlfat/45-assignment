//Task 24
//More Conditional Tests: You donâ€™t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. 
//If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests. Have at least one True and one 
//False result for each of the following:

//Tests for equality and inequality with strings

//Tests using the lower case function

//Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, 
//greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to

//Tests using "and" and "or" operators

//Test whether an item is in a array

//Test whether an item is not in a array
