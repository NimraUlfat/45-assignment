//Task 10
//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least 
//one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your 
//programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at 
//the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// For Addition
console.log(4 + 4);
// For Subtraction
console.log(12 - 4);
// For Multiplication
console.log(2 * 4);
// For Division
console.log(16 / 2);
