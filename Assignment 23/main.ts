//Task 23
//Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing 
//each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look
//something like this:

//let car = 'subaru';

//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

//console.log(car == 'subaru')

//Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to 
//True or False.

//Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests 
//evaluate to False.

//Making a veriable
let five = 5;
let ten = 10;
//Test 1
console.log("Test 1: Five is equal 5?");
console.log(five == 5);
//Test 2
console.log("Test 2: ten is equal to 10?");
console.log(ten == 10);
//Test 3
console.log("Test 3: Five is not equal to ten");
console.log(five != ten);
//Test 4
console.log("Test 4: Ten is greater then five?");
console.log(ten > 5);
//Test 5
console.log("Test 5: Five is samller than ten");
console.log(five < ten);
//Test 6
console.log("Test 6: ten is greater than five?");
console.log(ten < five);
//Test 7
console.log("Test 7: five is equal to ten");
console.log(five == ten);
//Test 8
console.log("Test 8: ten is not equal to ten");
console.log(ten != ten);
//Test 9
console.log("Test 9: five is greater than ten");
console.log(five > ten);
//Test 10
console.log("Test 10: Hundred is smaller than fifty");
console.log(100 < 50);
