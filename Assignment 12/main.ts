//Task 12
//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing 
//each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, 
//but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

//Starting with the array used in Exercise 11
let friendsName = ["Taeghung","Jungkook","Jimin","Suga"];

//Printing the same message withpersonlized person name
friendsName.forEach(friendName => console.log(`Hello ${friendName} Whats going on?`));
